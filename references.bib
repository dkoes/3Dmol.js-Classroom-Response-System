    abstract = { Web-based classroom response systems offer a variety of benefits versus traditional clicker technology. They are simple to use for students and faculty and offer various question types suitable for a broad spectrum of chemistry classes. They facilitate active learning pedagogies like peer instruction and successfully engage students in the learning environment. Example problems for Organic I and II are shown to highlight potential uses of one Web-based system. }
